# Maldua's Zimbra ActiveSync

## About

**MALDUA'S Zimbra ActiveSync Extension & Administration Zimlet** brought to you by [BTACTIC, open source & cloud solutions](https://www.btactic.com).

ActiveSync is a mobile data synchronization app developed by Microsoft, originally released in 1996. It synchronizes data with handheld devices and desktop computers.

This ActiveSync helper will improve integration with [Z-Push](https://github.com/Z-Hub/Z-Push/) and [Z-Push Zimbra Backend](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zimbrabackend/). **It does not bring an equivalent functionality to an ActiveSync server on its own.**

**WARNING: The development stage is in ALPHA QUALITY and it is not ready for production deployment.**
